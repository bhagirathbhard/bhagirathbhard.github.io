About Me
======
As a current student at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University, I am a highly motivated and analytical individual with a strong background in business analytics, computer science, and applied mathematics. I recently worked at LeanIX as a Product Manager, where I led the development of out-of-the-box integrations for the Enterprise Architecture Management platform and defined product strategy, customer acquisition and retention strategy. Prior to this role, I worked as a Customer Success Engineer at LeanIX, where I provided technical solutions for customers and led technical product presentations to prospects.

In addition to my professional experience, I am skilled in Python, SQL, Java, and HTML/CSS, and am proficient in tools such as JIRA, Confluence, Pendo, Productboard, Gainsight, Zendesk, Slack, Salesforce, Azure Logging, Docker, GitHub, ServiceNow Administration, Tableau, and PowerBI. I have also received certifications in McKinsey Product Academy Fundamentals, Bloomberg Market Concepts, AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

I am passionate about using data to drive business decisions and am eager to continue learning and growing in my career. I believe that my skills and experience make me well-suited for roles in business analytics and product management. I welcome the opportunity to connect with others on LinkedIn and would be happy to discuss any potential opportunities.
